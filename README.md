Official repo for the paper "Input Conditioned Layer Dropping in Speech Foundation Models" accepted at IEEE Machine Learning and Signal Processing (MLSP) 2025.

Paper is available -- **Input Conditioned Layer Dropping in Speech Foundation Models**(https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07954).

## Summary
This paper targets to convert a static foundation model into a dynamic foundation model, by employing "Layer Dropping" technique to skip / drop sub-modules of the encoder. We proposed a lightweight plug-and-play "Layer Selecting" block that allows skipping / dropping of encoder sub-modules based on the current input.

More Details coming soon. Stay Tuned !!
